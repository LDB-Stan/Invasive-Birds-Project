# Invasive Birds Project  

![Invasive birds banner](images/Invasive_birds_banner.jpg)

## Overview

North America has several introduced invasive bird species. Among the most common are Pigeons (Rock Doves), Eurasian Collared Doves, and Ring-necked Pheasants. This project concerns only invasive cavity nesting birds. The invasive species of focus are the House Sparrow (aka English Sparrow), the European Starling, and the Eurasian Tree Sparrow.

*Note: House Finches, which are cavity nesters, are considered invasive in many regions of North America. However, they **are** native to North America, and thus shall not be classified as invasive for the purposes of this study.*

## Background

While it's common knowledge among the bird enthusiasts, most people in North America aren't aware that there are two particularly aggressive invasive cavity nesting bird species that are of major detriment to the smaller and/or less aggressive native cavity nesters.  

European Starlings are a particular threat to species of woodpeckers and flickers, but will also "evict" smaller species which have a nest opening large enough to accommodate them.

Native cavity nesters known to be the most impacted by House Sparrows are species of bluebirds and chickadees, as well as Tree Swallows. The small size of the House Sparrow, which allows them access to the nest cavities, makes them a particular threat to these native birds.

Purple Martins fall victim to both European Starlings and House Sparrows, which is often stated to be a contributing factor the decline in Purple Martin populations.  

Eurasian Tree Sparrows are said to be limited to the area of St. Louis, MO and surrounding areas in Illinois and Iowa. While smaller and less aggressive than House Sparrows, there is evidence that they will attack and kill Eastern Bluebirds.

## About this project

In this project, the aim is to *quantify* what is widely considered as common knowledge, seek measurable correlations between the populations of native North American cavity nesting species and the populations of the introduced invasive species, and look for trends.  

While there is a vast number of native North American cavity nesting species, this study will only include those which could reasonably be expected to be directly affected by the invasive species. For that reason, some native cavity nesters, including species of waterfowl, owls, and kestrels have been left out.
